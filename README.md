# Team Project
 Used for Software Engineering
Project Selection and Proposal:
You and your team will meet to brainstorm and discuss potential Apps that you will model in your project.
Potential projects should be selected from either:

• an existing App,

• an enhancement to an existing App,

• a new App for an existing website/desktop application, or

• a brand new idea.

For example, you may want to model the Twitter mobile App or enhance a desktop application program like
MS Media Player. You should select an App with approximately 5-7 different functions. A project with more
than 7 functions will be too large in scope for the timeline; a project with fewer than 5 functions will not give
you enough in-depth experience.


After selecting an App, your team will then draft a project proposal, create and deliver a proposal
presentation to the class and submit it for approval to your instructor. Approval will be granted for projects
that are appropriate in size for the tasks required during the semester. Your instructor will guide you
through this scope definition process.
